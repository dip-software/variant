# Variant
Helps [Thanos](https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-cloudfoundry-thanos) reach out to CF resources for scraping

# How
We'll leverage metadata (labels, annotations) resource enrichment of the Cloud foundry platform to implement 
service discovery and configuration of resources. What variant does:
- Automatic network-policy management
- Discovery of scrape targets
- Rules discovery
- A demonstration vehicle for using labels and annotations in Cloud foundry
